aria2 1.26.0
============

Release Note
------------

This release fixes linking bug with libaria2 enabled.  It also changes
how aria2 renames the download file name when the same name already
exists in file system.  In summary, we use numbers before extension
(e.g., foo.1.txt), rather than after extension (e.g., foo.txt.1).  Now
--seed-time option can take floating point number to specify
fractional minutes.

* Better auto-renaming

  Up until now aria2 file auto renaming worked by just appending a new
  unique number to the file path, behind the file name extension, if
  any, changing what most other programs consider the file extension
  in the process.  Now, aria2 will attempt to insert the number before
  the file extension, leaving the extension intact, so that e.g. a
  ".jpg" still is a ".jpg" file and opens in your configured image
  viewer when clicking it.  If a file has no extension (incl. so
  called "dot files"), the number will be appended to the file name as
  usual.

  Note: This is a potentially breaking change that might break third
  party scripts that rely on aria2 auto file renaming producing a
  certain format for renamed files. Please fix your scripts
  accordingly.

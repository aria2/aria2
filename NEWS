aria2 1.16.2
============

Release Note
------------

This release fixes the bug which causes long running BitTorrent
download to stall. The several new options have been added.

Changes
-------

* Check SSL_OP_NO_COMPRESSION is available before using it

* Fix bug returnPeer is not called if sequence_ == INITIATOR_SEND_KEY

  In InitiatorMSEHandshakeCommand, when aborting connection, we must
  return peer to the PeerStorage. But it is not done if sequence_ is
  INITIATOR_SEND_KEY. This causes stale Peer objects whose usedBy()
  returns true eventually occupies peer list and aria2 cannot make any
  connections.

* Accept k and m as well as K and M in util::getRealSize()

* mingw32: Make NTFS sparse file on --file-allocation=trunc

* Added --save-session-interval option

  --save-session-interval option saves error/unfinished downloads to a
  file specified by --save-session option every SEC seconds. If 0 is
  given, file will be saved only when aria2 exits.

* Use request URI as referer if --referer="*" is given

* Log warn if unknown option is found in config file or -i file

* Added --console-log-level option

  --console-log-level option sets log level to output to console.



aria2 1.16.1
============

Release Note
------------

This release adds the ability to persist GID across sessions. The GID
will be saved with --save-session. There are several restrictions how
GID is persisted. See the manual for details. For this change, now GID
is 64 bits binary data and represented by 16 characters hex string in
RPC query.  The disk cache feature was added, which may reduce disk
activity. The console readout was redesigned. The warning displayed
when --file-allocation=falloc is used on MinGW32 build was removed as
a bug.

Changes
-------

* mingw32: Re-open files with read-only mode enabled on seeding

  On Mingw32 build, if aria2 opens file with GENERIC_WRITE access
  right, some programs cannot open the file aria2 is seeding. To avoid
  this situation, re-open files with read-only enabled when seeding is
  about to begin.

* Save gid option with --save-session option

* Added --gid option

  This option sets GID manually. aria2 identifies each download by the
  ID called GID. The GID must be hex string of 16 characters, thus
  [0-9a-zA-Z] are allowed and leading zeros must not be stripped. The
  GID all 0 is reserved and must not be used. The GID must be unique,
  otherwise error is reported and the download is not added.  This
  option is useful when restoring the sessions saved using
  --save-session option. If this option is not used, new GID is
  generated by aria2.

* Use 64 bits random bytes as GID

  This change replaces the current 64 bit sequential GID with 64 bits
  random bytes GID in an attempt to support persistent
  GID. Internally, the GID is stored as uint64_t. For human
  representation and RPC interface, GID is represented as 16 bytes hex
  string. For console readout, 16 bytes are too long, so it is
  abbreviated to first 6 bytes.  When querying GID in RPC calls, user
  can speicfy the prefix of GID as long as the prefix is shared by
  more than 1 GID entries.

* Fixed BitfieldMan::getOffsetCompletedLength overflow on 32-bit systems

* mingw32: Use HANDLE only for MinGW32 build

* Changed console readout, making it more compact

  "SIZE:" is removed because it is obvious. SEEDING, SEED, SPD and UP
  are now replaced with SEED, SD, DL and UL respectively.

* Compact readout when more than 1 simultaneous downloads are going on

  If more than 1 simultaneous downloads are going on, use more compact
  format in readout. Currently, at most 5 download stats are
  displayed.

  util::abbrevSize() is rewritten to support "Gi" unit and provides
  more compact abbreviation.

* Console color output

  Log level and download result string is now colored.

* Logger: Simplified console output and change level format in log

  The date and time are now removed from console output.  The log
  level is now formatted as "[LEVEL]".

* Start to find faster host before the number of missing segments becomes 1

  The old implementation starts to find faster host when the number of
  missing segment becomes 1. Because of --min-split-size option,
  before the number of missing segment becomes 1, the number of
  connection becomes 1 and it can be slow. In this case, we have to
  wait until the last segment is reached. The new implementation
  starts to find faster host when the remaining length is less than
  --min-split-size * 2, to mitigate the problem stated above.

* Removed warning when --file-allocation=falloc is used in MinGW32 build

  The warning was just a mistake. SetFilePointerEx + SetEndOfFile
  actually allocate disk space.

* Write data in 4K aligned offset in write with disk cache enabled

  This greatly reduces disk activity especially on Win + NTFS.  Not so
  much difference on Linux.

* mingw32: Removed FSCTL_SET_SPARSE set

* Added --disk-cache option

  This option enables disk cache. If SIZE is 0, the disk cache is
  disabled. This feature caches the downloaded data in memory, which
  grows to at most SIZE bytes. The cache storage is created for aria2
  instance and shared by all downloads. The one advantage of the disk
  cache is reduce the disk seek time because the data is written in
  larger unit and it is reordered by the offset of the file. If the
  underlying file is heavily fragmented it is not the case.



aria2 1.16.0
============

Release Note
------------

This release adds SSL/TLS encryption support in RPC transport. The new
RPC method aria2.appendUri is added, which is a wrapper to
aria2.changeUri. The Content-Disposition parser is now RFC 6266
conformant. The resource leak in XmlParser, JSON and Bencode parser
was fixed. The uploaded data size calculation bug was fixed. For
MinGW32 build, files are now opened with read/write shared mode.

Changes
-------

* mingw32: Open file using _wsopen and added --enable-mmap support

  I tried CreateFile but the subsequent ReadFile fails with Access
  Denied if sparse file is read on NTFS. I mostly reverted previous
  changes and use _wsopen with read/write share enabled instead of
  CreateFile.

  This change also includes --enable-mmap support for MinGW32
  build. Memory mapped file may be useful for 64-bits OS and lots of
  RAM. Currently, FlushViewOfFile is not called during the download,
  so it is slightly vulnerable against sudden power loss. I found lots
  of read when resuming download due to page fault. So for now it is
  useful for the initial download. I recommend not to use
  --file-allocation=prealloc with --enable-mmap for MinGW32, because
  it triggers page faults even in the initial download. Anyway, the
  option is experimental.

* Removed PO files and generated aria2.pot from repository

  Currently, message translation is done at launchpad.  All PO files
  can be exported from there. The merge process from launchpad is done
  when new release. First download export file from launchpad And use
  import-po script to import PO files into po directory.

* Set F_GLOBAL_NOCACHE for Mac OS X

* Enabled TCP_NODELAY

* Don't use AC_FUNC_MMAP

  Don't use AC_FUNC_MMAP becaue it fails on some platforms (e.g.,
  OpenWRT) which have mmap and it works in the way we use in aria2.
  Instead use mmap in AC_CHECK_FUNCS list.

* Added --force-save option.

  --force-save option saves download with --save-session option even
  if the download is completed or removed. This may be useful to save
  BitTorrent seeding which is recognized as completed state.  The
  default value is false.

* Get the correct uploaded data size

  Subtract msgHdrLen_ from writtenLength to get the uploaded data
  size.  Without this correction, the seeder assumes it has uploaded
  more data than it actually has.

* Made --http-no-cache false by default

* Fixed memory leak in AsyncNameResolver

* Fixed resource leak in XmlParser and GenericParser

* Reset iostream format state

* gnutls: Added more status checking when verifying peer

* Content-Disposition parser conforming to RFC 6266.

  RFC 2231 Continuation is not supported.

* Reworked download/upload statistics calculation

  The old implementation calculates download/upload statistics for a
  RequestGroup by summing up all PeerStat objects. For global
  statistics, those are summed together. This clearly incurs runtime
  penalty and we introduced some kind of caching which updates
  statistics every 250ms but it did not work right.

  This change removes all these aggregation code, and instead makes
  RequestGroup and RequestGroupMan objects hold NetStat object and
  download/upload bytes are directly calculated by thier own NetStat.
  This is far more simplar than the old way and less runtime penalty
  and brings more accuracy.

* Added --rpc-save-upload-metadata option

  If true is given, which is default, save the uploaded torrent or
  metalink metadata in the directory specified by --dir option. The
  filename consists of SHA1-hash hex string of metadata plus
  extension. For torrent, the extension is '.torrent'. For metalink,
  it is '.meta4'.  If false is given to this option, the downloads
  added by aria2.addTorrent or aria2.addMetalink will not be saved by
  --save-session option.

* Perform SSL/TLS handshake after checking whether connection is established

* Fixed bug that --enable-mmap won't work if MultiDiskAdaptor is used

* RPC over SSL/TLS transport

  To enable RPC over SSL/TLS, specify server certificate and private
  key using --rpc-certificate and --rpc-private-key options and enable
  --rpc-secure option.  After the encryption is enabled, use https and
  wss scheme to access RPC server.

* aria2rpc: Added appendUri command

  This command calls aria2.changeUri(GID, fileIndex, [], [URI,...])
  internally.

* Don't send Proxy-Connection header field

* Don't set SNI hostname if it does not include "." for GNUTLS

* Disable SSL/TLS compression with OpenSSL

* Pause download even if download is completed

  This allows to pause and unpause BitTorrent seed.

* Use execlp() instead of execl()

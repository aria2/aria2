aria2 1.27.0
============

Release Note
------------

This release fixes bug which may cause crash if UDP tracker is used.
It adds new option --save-not-found which prevents downloads failed by
"not found" error from being saved in session file.

Changes
-------

* Hard-disable openssl in osx build

  Closes #739

* Fix possible cause of crash if UDP tracker is used

* Remove custom ftruncate64 for Android

  The latest NDK versions support ftruncate64, so building a local
  copy of ftruncate64 is no longer needed.

  Also, the arm and x86 builds of ftruncate64 failed when targeting
  API level 21 or higher, as they include <linux/err.h> which are not
  present starting from API level 21.

  Patch from Fredrik Fornwall

* Fix typo found by Debian's Lintian

* Add --save-not-found option

* Update comment to match code

  Patch from Torbjörn Lönnemark

* WinTLS: Better errors (from WSA)

* Compile with openssl 1.1.0

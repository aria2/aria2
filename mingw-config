# This is the configure script wrapper for cross-compiling MinGW32
# build on Debian Linux using mingw-w64. Some environment variables
# can be adjusted to change build settings:
#
# HOST: cross-compile to build programs to run on HOST. It defaults to
#       i686-w64-mingw32. To build 64 bit binary, specify
#       x86_64-w64-mingw32.
#
# PREFIX: Prefix to the directory where dependent libraries are
#       installed.  It defaults to /usr/local/$HOST. -I$PREFIX/include
#       will be added to CPPFLAGS. -L$PREFIX/lib will be added to
#       LDFLAGS. $PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig will be set to
#       PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR.
#
# In this configuration, the following dependent libraries are used:
#
# * c-ares
# * gmp
# * expat
# * sqlite3
# * zlib
# * libssh2
# * cppunit

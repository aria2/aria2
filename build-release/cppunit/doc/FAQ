1) Questions relating to CppUnit
   ----------------------------

1.1) Isn't there an easier way to write unit tests than using TestCaller ?

   Yes, there is. Macros have been created to take care of the repetitive 
work. Look up include/extensions/HelperMacros.h in CppUnit documentation. 
Most of CppUnit test suite is also written that way since they remain 
compatible as CppUnit evolve. They also use RTTI if available.


2) Questions related to Microsoft Visual VC++
   -----------------------------------------

2.1) Why does the compiler report an error when linking with CppUnit library?

   You most likely are not using the same C-RunTime library as CppUnit.
   In Release configuration, CppUnit use "Mulithreaded DLL".
   In Debug configurations, CppUnit use "Debug Multihreaded DLL".
   Check that Projects/Settings.../C++/Code Generation is indeed using
the correct library.
   
2.2) Why does CppUnit generate warning 4786:... when compiling ?

   I really don't have a clue. All CppUnit's headers starts by either
including Portability.h or another CppUnit's header. Portability.h includes
config-msvc6.h which disable that specific warning. The warning is generated
by TestFactoryRegistry::m_factories. A solution to this problem is welcome.

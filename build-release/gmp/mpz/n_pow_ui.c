/* mpz_pow_ui and mpz_ui_pow_ui want to share almost all of this code.
   ui_pow_ui doesn't need the mpn_mul based powering loop or the tests on
   bsize==2 or >2, but separating that isn't easy because there's shared
   code both before and after (the size calculations and the powers of 2
   handling).

   Alternatives:

   It would work to just use the mpn_mul powering loop for 1 and 2 limb
   bases, but the current separate loop allows mul_1 and mul_2 to be done
   in-place, which might help cache locality a bit.  If mpn_mul was relaxed
   to allow source==dest when vn==1 or 2 then some pointer twiddling might
   let us get the same effect in one loop.

   The initial powering for bsize==1 into blimb or blimb:blimb_low doesn't
   form the biggest possible power of b that fits, only the biggest power of
   2 power, ie. b^(2^n).  It'd be possible to choose a bigger power, perhaps
   using mp_bases[b].big_base for small b, and thereby get better value
   from mpn_mul_1 or mpn_mul_2 in the bignum powering.  It's felt that doing
   so would be more complicated than it's worth, and could well end up being
   a slowdown for small e.  For big e on the other hand the algorithm is
   dominated by mpn_sqr so there wouldn't much of a saving.  The current
   code can be viewed as simply doing the first few steps of the powering in
   a single or double limb where possible.

   If r==b, and blow_twos==0, and r must be realloc'ed, then the temporary
   copy made of b is unnecessary.  We could just use the old alloc'ed block
   and free it at the end.  But arranging this seems like a lot more trouble
   than it's worth.  */

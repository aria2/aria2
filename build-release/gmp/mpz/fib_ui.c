/* In the F[2k+1] below for k odd, the -2 won't give a borrow from the low
   limb because the result F[2k+1] is an F[4m+3] and such numbers are always
   == 1, 2 or 5 mod 8, whereas an underflow would leave 6 or 7.  (This is
   the same as in mpn_fib2_ui.)

   In the F[2k+1] for k even, the +2 won't give a carry out of the low limb
   in normal circumstances.  This is an F[4m+1] and we claim that F[3*2^b+1]
   == 1 mod 2^b is the first F[4m+1] congruent to 0 or 1 mod 2^b, and hence
   if n < 2^GMP_NUMB_BITS then F[n] cannot have a low limb of 0 or 1.  No
   proof for this claim, but it's been verified up to b==32 and has such a
   nice pattern it must be true :-).  Of interest is that F[3*2^b] == 0 mod
   2^(b+1) seems to hold too.

   When n >= 2^GMP_NUMB_BITS, which can arise in a nails build, then the low
   limb of F[4m+1] can certainly be 1, and an mpn_add_1 must be used.  */

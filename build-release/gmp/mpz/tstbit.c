/* For negatives the effective twos complement is achieved by negating the
   limb tested, either with a ones or twos complement.  Twos complement
   ("-") is used if there's only zero limbs below the one being tested.
   Ones complement ("~") is used if there's a non-zero below.  Note that "-"
   is correct even if the limb examined is 0 (and the true beginning of twos
   complement is further up).

   Testing the limbs below p is unavoidable on negatives, but will usually
   need to examine only *(p-1).  The search is done from *(p-1) down to
   *u_ptr, since that might give better cache locality, and because a
   non-zero limb is perhaps a touch more likely in the middle of a number
   than at the low end.

   Bits past the end of available data simply follow sign of u.  Notice that
   the limb_index >= abs_size test covers u=0 too.  */

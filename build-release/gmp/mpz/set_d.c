   double -> limb.  Unfortunately gcc 3.3 on powerpc970-apple-darwin6.8.5
   got this wrong.  (It assumed __fixunsdfdi returned its result in a single
   64-bit register, where instead that function followed the calling
   conventions and gave the result in two parts r3 and r4.)  Hence the use
   of __gmp_extract_double in all cases.  */

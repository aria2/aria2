/* For big divisors this code is only very slightly better than the user
   doing a combination of mpz_sub and mpz_tdiv_r, but it's quite convenient,
   and perhaps in the future can be improved, in similar ways to
   mpn_divisible_p perhaps.

   The csize==1 / dsize==1 special case makes mpz_congruent_p as good as
   mpz_congruent_ui_p on relevant operands, though such a combination
   probably doesn't occur often.

   Alternatives:

   If c<d then it'd work to just form a%d and compare a and c (either as
   a==c or a+c==d depending on the signs), but the saving from avoiding the
   abs(a-c) calculation would be small compared to the division.

   Similarly if both a<d and c<d then it would work to just compare a and c
   (a==c or a+c==d), but this isn't considered a particularly important case
   and so isn't done for the moment.

   Low zero limbs on d could be stripped and the corresponding limbs of a
   and c tested and skipped, but doing so would introduce a borrow when a
   and c differ in sign and have non-zero skipped limbs.  It doesn't seem
   worth the complications to do this, since low zero limbs on d should
   occur only rarely.  */

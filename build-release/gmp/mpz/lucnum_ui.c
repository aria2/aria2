/* Notes:

   For the +4 in L[2k+1] when k is even, all L[4m+3] == 4, 5 or 7 mod 8, so
   there can't be an overflow applying +4 to just the low limb (since that
   would leave 0, 1, 2 or 3 mod 8).

   For the -4 in L[2k+1] when k is even, it seems (no proof) that
   L[3*2^(b-2)-3] == -4 mod 2^b, so for instance with a 32-bit limb
   L[0xBFFFFFFD] == 0xFFFFFFFC mod 2^32, and this implies a borrow from the
   low limb.  Obviously L[0xBFFFFFFD] is a huge number, but it's at least
   conceivable to calculate it, so it probably should be handled.

   For the -2 in L[2k] with k even, it seems (no proof) L[2^(b-1)] == -1 mod
   2^b, so for instance in 32-bits L[0x80000000] has a low limb of
   0xFFFFFFFF so there would have been a borrow.  Again L[0x80000000] is
   obviously huge, but probably should be made to work.  */

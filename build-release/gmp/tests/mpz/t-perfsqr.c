/* check_modulo() exercises mpz_perfect_square_p on squares which cover each
   possible quadratic residue to each divisor used within
   mpn_perfect_square_p, ensuring those residues aren't incorrectly claimed
   to be non-residues.

   Each divisor is taken separately.  It's arranged that n is congruent to 0
   modulo the other divisors, 0 of course being a quadratic residue to any
   modulus.

   The values "(j*others)^2" cover all quadratic residues mod divisor[i],
   but in no particular order.  j is run from 1<=j<=divisor[i] so that zero
   is excluded.  A literal n==0 doesn't reach the residue tests.  */

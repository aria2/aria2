/* This apparently trivial test is designed to detect missing .type and
   .size directives in asm code, per the problem described under
   GMP_ASM_TYPE in acinclude.m4.

   A failure can be provoked in a shared or shared+static build by making
   TYPE and SIZE in config.m4 empty, either by editing it or by configuring
   with

       ./configure gmp_cv_asm_type= gmp_cv_asm_size=

   mpn_add_n is used for the test because normally it's implemented in
   assembler on a CPU that has any asm code.

   Enhancement: As noted with GMP_ASM_TYPE, if .type is wrong but .size is
   right then everything works, but uses code copied down to the mainline
   data area.  Maybe we could detect that if we built a test library with an
   object that had .size deliberately disabled.  */

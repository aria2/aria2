/* The size where udiv_qrnnd_preinv should be used rather than udiv_qrnnd,
   meaning the quotient size where that should happen, the quotient size
   being how many udiv divisions will be done.

   The default is to use preinv always, CPUs where this doesn't suit have
   tuned thresholds.  Note in particular that preinv should certainly be
   used if that's the only division available (USE_PREINV_ALWAYS).  */

/* If the cpu only has multiply-by-inverse division (eg. alpha), then NORM
   and UNNORM thresholds are 0 and only the inversion code is included.

   If multiply-by-inverse is never viable, then NORM and UNNORM thresholds
   will be MP_SIZE_T_MAX and only the plain division code is included.

   Otherwise mul-by-inverse is better than plain division above some
   threshold, and best results are obtained by having code for both present.

   The main reason for separating the norm and unnorm cases is that not all
   CPUs give zero for "n0 >> GMP_LIMB_BITS" which would arise in the unnorm
   code used on an already normalized divisor.

   If UDIV_NEEDS_NORMALIZATION is false then plain division uses the same
   non-shifting code for both the norm and unnorm cases, though with
   different criteria for skipping a division, and with different thresholds
   of course.  And in fact if inversion is never viable, then that simple
   non-shifting division would be all that's left.

   The NORM and UNNORM thresholds might not differ much, but if there's
   going to be separate code for norm and unnorm then it makes sense to have
   separate thresholds.  One thing that's possible is that the
   mul-by-inverse might be better only for normalized divisors, due to that
   case not needing variable bit shifts.

   Notice that the thresholds are tested after the decision to possibly skip
   one divide step, so they're based on the actual number of divisions done.

   For the unnorm case, it would be possible to call mpn_lshift to adjust
   the dividend all in one go (into the quotient space say), rather than
   limb-by-limb in the loop.  This might help if mpn_lshift is a lot faster
   than what the compiler can generate for EXTRACT.  But this is left to CPU
   specific implementations to consider, especially since EXTRACT isn't on
   the dependent chain.  */

  Computes:

  (1) {rp,n} := {up,n} + {vp,n} (just like mpn_add_n) with incoming carry cy,
  return value is carry out.

  (2) Let c[i+1] = carry from i-th limb addition (c[0] = cy).
  Computes c[1]*yp1[n-1] + ... + c[n]*yp1[0],
           c[1]*yp2[n-1] + ... + c[n]*yp2[0],
  stores two-limb results at {ep,2} and {ep+2,2} respectively.

  Requires n >= 1.

  None of the outputs may overlap each other or any of the inputs, except
  that {rp,n} may be equal to {up,n} or {vp,n}.

/* Divide num {np,nn} by den {dp,2} and write the nn-2 least significant
   quotient limbs at qp and the 2 long remainder at np.  If qxn is non-zero,
   generate that many fraction bits and append them after the other quotient
   limbs.  Return the most significant limb of the quotient, this is always 0
   or 1.

   Preconditions:
   1. The most significant bit of the divisor must be set.
   2. qp must either not overlap with the input operands at all, or
      qp >= np + 2 must hold true.  (This means that it's possible to put
      the quotient in the high part of {np,nn}, right above the remainder.
   3. nn >= 2, even if qxn is non-zero.  */

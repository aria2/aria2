/* Multiply {up,usize} by {vp,vsize} and write the result to
   {prodp,usize+vsize}.  Must have usize>=vsize.

   Note that prodp gets usize+vsize limbs stored, even if the actual result
   only needs usize+vsize-1.

   There's no good reason to call here with vsize>=MUL_TOOM22_THRESHOLD.
   Currently this is allowed, but it might not be in the future.

   This is the most critical code for multiplication.  All multiplies rely
   on this, both small and huge.  Small ones arrive here immediately, huge
   ones arrive here as this is the base case for Karatsuba's recursive
   algorithm.  */

/* Size analysis for hgcd:

   For the recursive calls, we have n1 <= ceil(n / 2). Then the
   storage need is determined by the storage for the recursive call
   computing M1, and hgcd_matrix_adjust and hgcd_matrix_mul calls that use M1
   (after this, the storage needed for M1 can be recycled).

   Let S(r) denote the required storage. For M1 we need 4 * (ceil(n1/2) + 1)
   = 4 * (ceil(n/4) + 1), for the hgcd_matrix_adjust call, we need n + 2,
   and for the hgcd_matrix_mul, we may need 3 ceil(n/2) + 8. In total,
   4 * ceil(n/4) + 3 ceil(n/2) + 12 <= 10 ceil(n/4) + 12.

   For the recursive call, we need S(n1) = S(ceil(n/2)).

   S(n) <= 10*ceil(n/4) + 12 + S(ceil(n/2))
	<= 10*(ceil(n/4) + ... + ceil(n/2^(1+k))) + 12k + S(ceil(n/2^k))
	<= 10*(2 ceil(n/4) + k) + 12k + S(ceil(n/2^k))
	<= 20 ceil(n/4) + 22k + S(ceil(n/2^k))

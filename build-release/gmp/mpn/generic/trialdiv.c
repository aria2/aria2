/*
   This function finds the first (smallest) factor represented in
   trialdivtab.h.  It does not stop the factoring effort just because it has
   reached some sensible limit, such as the square root of the input number.

   The caller can limit the factoring effort by passing NPRIMES.  The function
   will then divide until that limit, or perhaps a few primes more.  A position
   which only mpn_trialdiv can make sense of is returned in the WHERE
   parameter.  It can be used for restarting the factoring effort; the first
   call should pass 0 here.

   Input:        1. A non-negative number T = {tp,tn}
                 2. NPRIMES as described above,
                 3. *WHERE as described above.
   Output:       1. *WHERE updated as described above.
                 2. Return value is non-zero if we found a factor, else zero
                    To get the actual prime factor, compute the mod B inverse
                    of the return value.

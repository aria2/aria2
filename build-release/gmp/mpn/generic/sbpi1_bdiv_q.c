/* Computes Q = N / D mod B^nn, destroys N.

   D must be odd. dinv is (-D)^-1 mod B.


   The straightforward way to compute Q is to cancel one limb at a time, using

     qp[i] = D^{-1} * np[i] (mod B)
     N -= B^i * qp[i] * D

   But we prefer addition to subtraction, since mpn_addmul_1 is often faster
   than mpn_submul_1.  Q = - N / D can be computed by iterating

     qp[i] = (-D)^{-1} * np[i] (mod B)
     N += B^i * qp[i] * D

   And then we flip the sign, -Q = (not Q) + 1. */

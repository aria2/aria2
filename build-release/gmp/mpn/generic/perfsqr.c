/* PERFSQR_MOD_* detects non-squares using residue tests.

   A macro PERFSQR_MOD_TEST is setup by gen-psqr.c in perfsqr.h.  It takes
   {up,usize} modulo a selected modulus to get a remainder r.  For 32-bit or
   64-bit limbs this modulus will be 2^24-1 or 2^48-1 using PERFSQR_MOD_34,
   or for other limb or nail sizes a PERFSQR_PP is chosen and PERFSQR_MOD_PP
   used.  PERFSQR_PP_NORM and PERFSQR_PP_INVERTED are pre-calculated in this
   case too.

   PERFSQR_MOD_TEST then makes various calls to PERFSQR_MOD_1 or
   PERFSQR_MOD_2 with divisors d which are factors of the modulus, and table
   data indicating residues and non-residues modulo those divisors.  The
   table data is in 1 or 2 limbs worth of bits respectively, per the size of
   each d.

   A "modexact" style remainder is taken to reduce r modulo d.
   PERFSQR_MOD_IDX implements this, producing an index "idx" for use with
   the table data.  Notice there's just one multiplication by a constant
   "inv", for each d.

   The modexact doesn't produce a true r%d remainder, instead idx satisfies
   "-(idx<<PERFSQR_MOD_BITS) == r mod d".  Because d is odd, this factor
   -2^PERFSQR_MOD_BITS is a one-to-one mapping between r and idx, and is
   accounted for by having the table data suitably permuted.

   The remainder r fits within PERFSQR_MOD_BITS which is less than a limb.
   In fact the GMP_LIMB_BITS - PERFSQR_MOD_BITS spare bits are enough to fit
   each divisor d meaning the modexact multiply can take place entirely
   within one limb, giving the compiler the chance to optimize it, in a way
   that say umul_ppmm would not give.

   There's no need for the divisors d to be prime, in fact gen-psqr.c makes
   a deliberate effort to combine factors so as to reduce the number of
   separate tests done on r.  But such combining is limited to d <=
   2*GMP_LIMB_BITS so that the table data fits in at most 2 limbs.

   Alternatives:

   It'd be possible to use bigger divisors d, and more than 2 limbs of table
   data, but this doesn't look like it would be of much help to the prime
   factors in the usual moduli 2^24-1 or 2^48-1.

   The moduli 2^24-1 or 2^48-1 are nothing particularly special, they're
   just easy to calculate (see mpn_mod_34lsub1) and have a nice set of prime
   factors.  2^32-1 and 2^64-1 would be equally easy to calculate, but have
   fewer prime factors.

   The nails case usually ends up using mpn_mod_1, which is a lot slower
   than mpn_mod_34lsub1.  Perhaps other such special moduli could be found
   for the nails case.  Two-term things like 2^30-2^15-1 might be
   candidates.  Or at worst some on-the-fly de-nailing would allow the plain
   2^24-1 to be used.  Currently nails are too preliminary to be worried
   about.

/* Calculate a remainder from {p,n} divided by 2^(GMP_NUMB_BITS*3/4)-1.
   The remainder is not fully reduced, it's any limb value congruent to
   {p,n} modulo that divisor.

   This implementation is only correct when GMP_NUMB_BITS is a multiple of
   4.

   FIXME: If GMP_NAIL_BITS is some silly big value during development then
   it's possible the carry accumulators c0,c1,c2 could overflow.

   General notes:

   The basic idea is to use a set of N accumulators (N=3 in this case) to
   effectively get a remainder mod 2^(GMP_NUMB_BITS*N)-1 followed at the end
   by a reduction to GMP_NUMB_BITS*N/M bits (M=4 in this case) for a
   remainder mod 2^(GMP_NUMB_BITS*N/M)-1.  N and M are chosen to give a good
   set of small prime factors in 2^(GMP_NUMB_BITS*N/M)-1.

   N=3 M=4 suits GMP_NUMB_BITS==32 and GMP_NUMB_BITS==64 quite well, giving
   a few more primes than a single accumulator N=1 does, and for no extra
   cost (assuming the processor has a decent number of registers).

   For strange nailified values of GMP_NUMB_BITS the idea would be to look
   for what N and M give good primes.  With GMP_NUMB_BITS not a power of 2
   the choices for M may be opened up a bit.  But such things are probably
   best done in separate code, not grafted on here.  */

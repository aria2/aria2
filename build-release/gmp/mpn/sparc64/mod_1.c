/* 32-bit divisors are treated in special case code.  This requires 4 mulx
   per limb instead of 8 in the general case.

   For big endian systems we need HALF_ENDIAN_ADJ included in the src[i]
   addressing, to get the two halves of each limb read in the correct order.
   This is kept in an adj variable.  Doing that measures about 6 c/l faster
   than just writing HALF_ENDIAN_ADJ(i) in the loop.  The latter shouldn't
   be 6 cycles worth of work, but perhaps it doesn't schedule well (on gcc
   3.2.1 at least).

   A simple udivx/umulx loop for the 32-bit case was attempted for small
   sizes, but at size==2 it was only about the same speed and at size==3 was
   slower.  */

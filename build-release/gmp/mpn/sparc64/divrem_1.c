/* 32-bit divisors are treated in special case code.  This requires 4 mulx
   per limb instead of 8 in the general case.

   For big endian systems we need HALF_ENDIAN_ADJ included in the src[i]
   addressing, to get the two halves of each limb read in the correct order.
   This is kept in an adj variable.  Doing that measures about 4 c/l faster
   than just writing HALF_ENDIAN_ADJ(i) in the integer loop.  The latter
   shouldn't be 6 cycles worth of work, but perhaps it doesn't schedule well
   (on gcc 3.2.1 at least).  The fraction loop doesn't seem affected, but we
   still use a variable since that ought to work out best.  */

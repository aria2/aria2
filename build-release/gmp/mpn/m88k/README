                      M88K MPN SUBROUTINES

This directory contains mpn functions for various m88k family chips.

CODE ORGANIZATION

	m88k             m88000, m88100
	m88k/mc88110     m88110

STATUS

The code herein is old and poorly maintained.

* The .s files assume the system uses a "_" underscore prefix, which
  should be controlled by configure.

* The mc88110/*.S files are using the defunct "sysdep.h" configuration
  scheme and won't compile.

Conversion to the current m4 .asm style wouldn't be difficult.

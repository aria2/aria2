/* The extension here is three versions of an mpn arithmetic mean.  These
   aren't meant to be particularly useful, just examples.

   You can run something like the following to compare their speeds.

           ./speed-ext -s 1-20 -c mean_calls mean_open mean_open2

   On RISC chips, mean_open() might be fastest if the compiler is doing a
   good job.  On the register starved x86s, mean_calls will be fastest.


   Notes:

   SPEED_EXTRA_PROTOS and SPEED_EXTRA_ROUTINES are macros that get expanded
   by speed.c in useful places.  SPEED_EXTRA_PROTOS goes after the header
   files, and SPEED_EXTRA_ROUTINES goes in the array of available routines.

   The advantage of this #include "speed.c" scheme is that there's no
   editing of a copy of that file, and new features in new versions of it
   will be immediately available.

   In a real program the routines mean_calls() etc would probably be in
   separate C or assembler source files, and just the measuring
   speed_mean_calls() etc would be here.  Linking against other libraries
   for things to measure is perfectly possible too.

   When attempting to compare two versions of the same named routine, say
   like the generic and assembler versions of mpn_add_n(), creative use of
   cc -D or #define is suggested, so one or both can be renamed and linked
   into the same program.  It'll be much easier to compare them side by side
   than with separate programs for each.

   common.c has notes on writing speed measuring routines.

   Remember to link against tune/libspeed.la (or tune/.libs/libspeed.a if
   not using libtool) to get common.o and other objects needed by speed.c.  */

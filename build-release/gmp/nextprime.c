/*
  Optimisation ideas:

  1. Unroll the sieving loops.  Should reach 1 write/cycle.  That would be a 2x
     improvement.

  2. Separate sieving with primes p < SIEVESIZE and p >= SIEVESIZE.  The latter
     will need at most one write, and thus not need any inner loop.

  3. For primes p >= SIEVESIZE, i.e., typically the majority of primes, we
     perform more than one division per sieving write.  That might dominate the
     entire run time for the nextprime function.  A incrementally initialised
     remainder table of Pi(65536) = 6542 16-bit entries could replace that
     division.

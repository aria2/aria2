/* glibc 2.0.x vsnprintf returns either -1 or size-1 for an overflow, with
   no indication how big the output would have been.  It's necessary to
   re-run to determine that size.

   "size-1" would mean success from a C99 vsnprintf, and the re-run is
   unnecessary in this case, but we don't bother to try to detect what sort
   of vsnprintf we've got.  size-1 should occur rarely in normal
   circumstances.

   vsnprintf might trash it's given ap (it does for instance in glibc 2.1.3
   on powerpc), so copy it in case we need to use it to probe for the size
   output that would have been produced.  Note there's no need to preserve
   it for our callers, just for ourselves.  */

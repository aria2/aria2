/* Each TMP_ALLOC uses __gmp_allocate_func to get a block of memory of the
   size requested, plus a header at the start which is used to hold the
   blocks on a linked list in the marker variable, ready for TMP_FREE to
   release.

   Callers should try to do multiple allocs with one call, in the style of
   TMP_ALLOC_LIMBS_2 if it's easy to arrange, since that will keep down the
   number of separate malloc calls.

   Enhancements:

   Could inline both TMP_ALLOC and TMP_FREE, though TMP_ALLOC would need the
   compiler to have "inline" since it returns a value.  The calls to malloc
   will be slow though, so it hardly seems worth worrying about one extra
   level of function call.  */

/* Not done:

   No attempt is made to identify an overlap u==v.  The result will be
   correct (1.0), but a full actual division is done whereas of course
   x/x==1 needs no work.  Such a call is not a sensible thing to make, and
   it's left to an application to notice and optimize if it might arise
   somehow through pointer aliasing or whatever.

   Enhancements:

   The high quotient limb is non-zero when high{up,vsize} >= {vp,vsize}.  We
   could make that comparison and use qsize==prec instead of qsize==prec+1,
   to save one limb in the division.

   If r==u but the size is enough bigger than prec that there won't be an
   overlap between quotient and dividend in mpn_div_q, then we can avoid
   copying up,usize.  This would only arise from a prec reduced with
   mpf_set_prec_raw and will be pretty unusual, but might be worthwhile if
   it could be worked into the copy_u decision cleanly.  */

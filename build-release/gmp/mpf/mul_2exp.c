/* Multiples of GMP_NUMB_BITS in exp simply mean an amount added to EXP(u)
   to set EXP(r).  The remainder exp%GMP_NUMB_BITS is then a left shift for
   the limb data.

   If exp%GMP_NUMB_BITS == 0 then there's no shifting, we effectively just
   do an mpz_set with changed EXP(r).  Like mpz_set we take prec+1 limbs in
   this case.  Although just prec would suffice, it's nice to have
   mpf_mul_2exp with exp==0 come out the same as mpz_set.

   When shifting we take up to prec many limbs from the input.  Our shift is
   cy = mpn_lshift (PTR(r), PTR(u)+k, size, ...), where k is the number of
   low limbs dropped from u, and the carry out is stored to PTR(r)[size].

   It may be noted that the low limb PTR(r)[0] doesn't incorporate bits from
   PTR(u)[k-1] (when k>=1 makes that limb available).  Taking just prec
   limbs from the input (with the high non-zero) is enough bits for the
   application requested precision, there's no need for extra work.

   If r==u the shift will have overlapping operands.  When k==0 (ie. when
   usize <= prec), the overlap is supported by lshift (ie. dst == src).

   But when r==u and k>=1 (ie. usize > prec), we would have an invalid
   overlap (ie. mpn_lshift (rp, rp+k, ...)).  In this case we must instead
   use mpn_rshift (PTR(r)+1, PTR(u)+k, size, NUMB-shift) with the carry out
   stored to PTR(r)[0].  An rshift by NUMB-shift bits like this gives
   identical data, it's just its overlap restrictions which differ.

   Enhancements:

   The way mpn_lshift is used means successive mpf_mul_2exp calls on the
   same operand will accumulate low zero limbs, until prec+1 limbs is
   reached.  This is wasteful for subsequent operations.  When abs_usize <=
   prec, we should test the low exp%GMP_NUMB_BITS many bits of PTR(u)[0],
   ie. those which would be shifted out by an mpn_rshift.  If they're zero
   then use that mpn_rshift.  */

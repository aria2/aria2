 * set to the length of the encoded name (not the length of the
 * expanded name; the goal is to tell the caller how many bytes to
 * move forward to get past the encoded name).
 *
 * In the simple case, an encoded name is a series of labels, each
 * composed of a one-byte length (limited to values between 0 and 63
 * inclusive) followed by the label contents.  The name is terminated
 * by a zero-length label.
 *
 * In the more complicated case, a label may be terminated by an
 * indirection pointer, specified by two bytes with the high bits of
 * the first byte (corresponding to INDIR_MASK) set to 11.  With the
 * two high bits of the first byte stripped off, the indirection
 * pointer gives an offset from the beginning of the containing
 * message with more labels to decode.  Indirection can happen an
 * arbitrary number of times, so we have to detect loops.
 *
 * Since the expanded name uses '.' as a label separator, we use
 * backslashes to escape periods or backslashes in the expanded name.

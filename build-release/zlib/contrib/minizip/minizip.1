.SH NAME
minizip - create ZIP archives
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B minizip
.RI [ -o ]
zipfile [ " files" ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B minizip
is a simple tool which allows the creation of compressed file archives
in the ZIP format used by the MS-DOS utility PKZIP.  It was written as
a demonstration of the
.IR zlib (3)
library and therefore lack many of the features of the
.IR zip (1)
program.
.SH OPTIONS
The first argument supplied is the name of the ZIP archive to create or
.RI -o
in which case it is ignored and the second argument treated as the
name of the ZIP file.  If the ZIP file already exists it will be
overwritten.
.PP
Subsequent arguments specify a list of files to place in the ZIP
archive.  If none are specified then an empty archive will be created.
.SH SEE ALSO

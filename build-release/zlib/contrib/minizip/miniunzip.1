.SH NAME
miniunzip - uncompress and examine ZIP archives
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B miniunzip
.RI [ -exvlo ]
zipfile [ files_to_extract ] [-d tempdir]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B minizip
is a simple tool which allows the extraction of compressed file
archives in the ZIP format used by the MS-DOS utility PKZIP.  It was
written as a demonstration of the
.IR zlib (3)
library and therefore lack many of the features of the
.IR unzip (1)
program.
.SH OPTIONS
A number of options are supported.  With the exception of
.BI \-d\  tempdir
these must be supplied before any
other arguments and are:
.TP
.BI \-l\ ,\ \-\-v
List the files in the archive without extracting them.
.TP
.B \-o
Overwrite files without prompting for confirmation.
.TP
.B \-x
Extract files (default).
.PP
The
.I zipfile
argument is the name of the archive to process. The next argument can be used
to specify a single file to extract from the archive.

Lastly, the following option can be specified at the end of the command-line:
.TP
.BI \-d\  tempdir
Extract the archive in the directory
.I tempdir
rather than the current directory.

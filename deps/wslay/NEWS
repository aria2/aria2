wslay 1.0.0
===========

Release Note
------------

This release fixes several build issues.  Most changes were introduced
by contributors.  Thank you for all the contributions in this project.
Because wslay is very stable since the previous release (more than 2
years ago), we mark this release 1.0.0.

Changes
-------

* Fix NULL check in wslay_frame_context_init.

  Patch from Witchakorn Kamolpornwijit

* the examples uses epoll and thus only be built on linux

  Patch from Kazuho Oku

* build: allow one to build out-of-tree documentation

  Patch from Vincent Bernat

* build: fix `./configure` when nettle is not present

  `PKG_CHECK_MODULES` will fail unless we give it an action to execute
  on failure. When nettle is not available, we set `have_nettle` to
  `no`.

  Patch from Vincent Bernat

* Adds the ability to override the version header include with a
  define.  This enables projects to set the build version from the
  compile environment and avoid the need to generate the version
  header.

  Patch from Ben Vanik

* Improve http_handshake in fork-echoserver.

  Patch from Gurjeet Singh

* Don't send any pending control frame other than Close control frame
  after Close is queued.
